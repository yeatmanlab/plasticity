Sensitive Periods for White Matter Plasticity in Human
Jason D. Yeatman & Elizabeth Huber

This repository contains code to simulate sensitive periods based on the data from:
   Huber E.G., Donnelly, P.M., Rokem A., Yeatman J.D. (2018).
   Rapid and widespread white matter plasticity during an intensive reading intervention. 
   Nature Communications. 9(1):2260

simulateAgeEffect.m performs the simulations and makes Figure 1 for the paper.
